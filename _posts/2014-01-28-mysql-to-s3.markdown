# Local MySQL backed up to S3

Same INI setting can be used as in [Backup MySQL DB to directory] [1] with only difference being engine.remote setting. See below example for details

[1]: /xtbackup/tutorial/mysql/file/mysql-to-file.html "Backup MySQL DB to directory"

``` ini

storage.s3.bucket=<Amazon S3 bucket name>

;;; generate "Access Keys" in Security Credentials in https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/
; This needs to be filled in if you want ot use s3 as storage, however prefered way is to use private INI file
; that can be stored in the more secure folder with limited access. So if you do not use separate INI file please
; uncomment below lines and fill in credentials.
;storage.s3.key.access=<access key>
;storage.s3.key.secret=<secret>

; set to true if you want to modify data in S3, if you just dry run it set it to simulate
storage.s3.update=true

; set engines
engine.outputs[]=cli
engine.local=mysql
engine.remote=s3
engine.compare=sqlite
```
