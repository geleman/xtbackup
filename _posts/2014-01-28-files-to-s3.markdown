[Basic]({% post_url 2014-01-28-basic %})

Let us start with simple example where we mirror `local` directory to `remote` directory.

This configuration will backup/mirror our pictures from user home folder `~/Pictures` (use something like `c:\Users\me\Pictures on Windows`)
to other local folder (for example mounted NAS in `/mnt/nas`).

{% highlight ini linenos %}

storage.filesystem.basedir=~/Pictures

storage.s3.bucket=<Amazon S3 bucket name>
;;; generate "Access Keys" in Security Credentials in https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/
; This needs to be filled in if you want ot use s3 as storage, however preferred way is to use private INI file
; that can be stored in the more secure folder with limited access. That way you can avoid accidentally committing
; your AWS credentials to potentially public repositories and losing $$$ in the process http://pulse.me/s/13oajD
; So if you do not use separate INI file please uncomment below lines and fill in credentials.
;storage.s3.key.access=<access key>
;storage.s3.key.secret=<secret>

; should upload/remove of data be executed? (yes/no/simulate)
;  yes:      will transfer data to S3
;  no:       will not start update process
;  simulate: will output progress, but will not really transfer data
storage.s3.update=yes

compare.sqlite.file=~/xtbackup.db

; engine.outputs[]=cli
engine.local=filesystem
engine.remote=s3
engine.compare=sqlite
{% endhighlight %}
