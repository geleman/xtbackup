To run backup you need to execute following command:

``` bash
php -f xtbackup.php -- ini[]=/path_to/your_ini_file.ini
```
of course this should ideally be added to the cron with MAILTO directive setup so you get notification.

You can specify what level of verbosity should be used with following option
output.cli.verbosity=WARNING

Possible values: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, DEBUG default being NOTICE

See link to INI examples below
